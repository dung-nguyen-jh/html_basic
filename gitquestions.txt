1. 
    it is ideal to base new feature's branch on the most stable branch exist so in this situation, it's a good idea to create
    a new branch from production.
    corresponding commands:
        git checkout production
        git checkout -b new_feature production 
        git push --set-upstream origin new_feature
2.
    approach 1:
        create a branch to hotfix this feature
            git checkout feature
            git checkout -b feature_hotfix
        fix the bug from this hotfix branch
        push the code to github
            git push --set-upstream origin feature_hotfix
        merge the code with feature and resolve conflicts if needed
            git fetch
            git checkout feature
            git merge feature_hotfix
